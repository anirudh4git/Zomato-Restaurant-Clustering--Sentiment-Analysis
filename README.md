# Zomato-Review-Sentniment-Analysis
Divided restaurants into segments using clustering techniques and also did sentiment analysis for the reviews.

Zomato is an Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants, and also has food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities.

_**First, I used KMeans clustering to cluster the restaurant based on cost, different cuisines, locality and meta-tags. Once a similar clusters of restaurants formed, I tried to analyse various clusters and look for some trend in the data.**_

_**Also this project focussed on Customers and Company, I analyzed the sentiments of the reviews given by the customer in the data and made some useful conclusion in the form of Visualizations. Basically the Sentiment analysis**_

The Analysis also solve some of the business cases that can directly help the customers finding the Best restaurant in their locality and for the company to grow up and work on the fields they are currently lagging in.

Also the data has valuable information around cuisine and costing which can be used in cost vs. benefit analysis.

Also the metadata of reviewers can be used for identifying the critics in the industry.
